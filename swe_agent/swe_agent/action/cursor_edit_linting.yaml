docstring: replaces *all* of the text between the START CURSOR and the END CURSOR with the replacement_text.
 The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement_text>
 will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. To enter text at the beginning of the file,
 set START CURSOR and END CURSOR to 0.
 Use set_cursors to move the cursors around. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit.
