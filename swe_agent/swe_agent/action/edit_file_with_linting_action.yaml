   edit_linting <start_line>:<end_line>
   <replacement_text>
   end_of_edit
 docstring: replaces lines <start_line> through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open file.
   The replacement_text text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All <replacement_text text>
   will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for
   syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed.
   Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command
   you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.
